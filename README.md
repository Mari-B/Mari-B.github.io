# My projects

This page includes some of the projects I've worked on recently, more specifically:

- a very simple memory game
- rock paper and scissors both in JS and in Python
- the final project I've worked on for the course I've completed with Sky. This is a web app created using Python, Flask and MySQL
- a simple modals demo using Sass, not accessible via the landing page and available here: https://mari-b.github.io/modals/modals
- a net salary calculator which uses HTML and JS for the logic, not accessible via the landing page and available here: https://mari-b.github.io/net-salary/
